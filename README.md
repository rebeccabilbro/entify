## ALGORITHM
Defines entities using kmeans clustering to identify locations based on
latitude & longitude.

## ABOUT THE DATA
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of
vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation
to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on
an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on
every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get
an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT
counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate
developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational
purposes. Data Owner: Transportation. Time Period: 2006. Frequency: A
citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years.
